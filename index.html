                    <li>
                        I am a very creative person who loves computers and so that makes <strong>graphic designing</strong> a perfect thing for me to do. My preferred software is <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> and <strong>Vectornator(On iPad)</strong>. I have made various logos and social media posts using this skill and I also work as a graphic designer in <strong><a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank">ACM</a> RGTU</strong>

                    <li>I can also play the <strong>keyboard and harmonium</strong>, this is more of a natural talent and I have'nt learnt any of it. I am not an expert by any means but given enough time I can play any song if I have heard it enough.</li>
